## About the language

> _Describe the language_
Kotlin is both an object oriented language and a functional programming language. It is an OSS statically typed programming language that targets the JVM, JavaSctipy, Native and Android. Developed by JetBrains, the project began an open source project very early on in 2010. Kotlin's first official 1.0 release was in February 2016. Kotlin has advantages over Java such as being more concise by estimates of about 40% less lines of code compared to Java when converted. Kotlin is also more type-safe than Java. More interesting features include smart casting, extension functions, higher-order fucntions and lambdas with receivers provide the ability to write expressive code as well as facilitating creation of domain-specific languages. Also Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java. There is even a Java-to-Kotlin converter built into the IDE. Kotlin is used for any kind of development. It can be used for server-side, client-said web and Android. Once development of Kotlin/Native finishes, it will support other platforms such as embedded systems, macOS and iOS. THe most popular uses of Kotlin is for mobile and server-side applications, client-side with JavaScript or JavaFX, and data science.

## About the syntax

> _give some code snippet of the language_

*function with unit return type and int params*

```Kotlin
fun printSum(a: Int, b: Int): Unit {
    println("sum of $a and $b is ${a + b}")
}
```

## About the tools

Kotlin can be used in multiple IDE's such as Android Studio, IntelliJ Idea and Eclipse. Kotlin can also be run from the command line by downloading the standalone compiler. The following commands compile then excute an example.kt file. 
$ kotlinc example.kt
$ kotlin exampleKt
