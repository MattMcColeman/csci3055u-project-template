This folder contains the sample code to illustrate some useful
functionalities and data structures offered by the standard
library of the language.

This code was tested from the windows command prompt.

After getting the kotlin stand alone compiler I was able to compile
using the command 

$ kotlinc kotlin-data-structures-and-functionalities.kt

then run the file in from that directory with the command

$ kotlin Kotlin_data_structures_and_functionalitiesKt
