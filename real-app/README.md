This folder contains the code of a reasonably real application 
implemented in the language.

The app is a survey app. It will bring one to the main activity
asking one to click the button to take a survey.
The survey then asks a yes or no question returning the answer to
the main activity to increment the value of a variable.
these variable values are then printed at the end to provide a 
summary of one's answers in a final activity.

This app utilizes the array data structure by storing the questions
in an xml file which are then called as the app increments through
the array. Intents are also used to pass data between activities. 
The basic syntax is used to calculate the users responses. The
app also uses a number of libraries commonly used in android app
development such as android.view.View.
